Dataset:

Name: Liver Disorders Dataset (Bupa Dataset)
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/liver-disorders/bupa.data
Features:
mcv (Mean Corpuscular Volume)
alkphos (Alkaline Phosphatase)
sgpt (Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase)
sgot (Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase)
gammagt (Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase)
drinks (Number of Half-Pint Equivalents of Beer Consumed per Day)
Target Variable:
selector ( Liver Disease Presence, 1 or 2)
Code Overview:

Data Loading:
Load the Liver Disorders Dataset from the UCI ML Repository using pd.read_csv().
Rename columns to match the dataset description.
Approach 1: Simple Linear Regression (SLR)
Predictor: mcv (Mean Corpuscular Volume)
Target: selector (Liver Disease Presence)
Modeling: Train an SLR model using LinearRegression() from sklearn.linear_model.
Evaluation: Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared Value.
Visualization: Scatter plot of Actual vs. Predicted values.
Approach 2: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
Predictors: All features except selector (i.e., mcv, alkphos, sgpt, sgot, gammagt, drinks)
Target: selector (Liver Disease Presence)
Modeling: Train an MLR model using LinearRegression() from sklearn.linear_model.
Evaluation: Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared Value.
Visualization:
Scatter plot of Actual vs. Predicted values.
Histogram of Predicted values.
Insights and Recommendations:

The SLR model uses only mcv as the predictor, which might not capture the complexity of the relationship between the features and the target variable.
The MLR model uses all available features, which can lead to better performance but also increases the risk of overfitting.
To improve the models, consider:
Feature engineering (e.g., interactions, polynomial transformations).
Regularization techniques (e.g., Lasso, Ridge).
Cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
Comparison with other machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest).
